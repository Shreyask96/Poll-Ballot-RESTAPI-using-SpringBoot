Architecture and Design

The application is built using Spring Boot and follows a simple REST architecture.

## Components
- `Candidate`: Represents a candidate with a name and vote count.
- `VotingService`: Contains the business logic for managing candidates and votes.
- `VotingController`: Exposes the API endpoints.
